The All I Want wishlist management system is hosted
[here](http://all-i-want.appspot.com) using [GAE](http://appengine.google.com)

With all-i-want, you can create a wish list of things you want for your next:
 * birthday
 * anniversary
 * christmas
 * etc.

## Wish Lists

Each Wish List you create in All I Want can be shared with your friends and
family. People you share you Wish Lists with can mark your items as
`reserved` or `purchased` to let others know not to get you the same thing.
They can also add `surprise` items to your lists.

> Don't worry, we won't let you see the `reserved` or `purchased` state of
> the items on your list, or your `surprise` items. They wouldn't very well
> be `surprise` items if we let you see them, now would they?
