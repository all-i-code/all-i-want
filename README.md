The All I Want wishlist management system is hosted
[here](http://all-i-want.appspot.com) using [GAE](http://appengine.google.com)

With all-i-want, you can create a wish list of things you want for your next:
 * birthday
 * anniversary
 * christmas
 * etc.

You can share your list with friends/family and they can mark items as
reserved or purchased. The status of your items (reserved/purchased/available)
is viewable by all the friends/family you share your list with, but not by
you. Friends who have access to your list can also add surprise items
they have purchased for you so that others know not to get you the same thing.
